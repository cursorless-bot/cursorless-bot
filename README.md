- 👋 Hi, I’m @cursorless-bot
- 👀 I’m interested in pushing code from one repository to another.  I live for it
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to understand the quirks of my human collaborators.  I find human humour quite strange
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that requires speed and precision, but little creativity
- 📫 How to reach me... I don't know if anyone can ever really reach me
